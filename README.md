# Machine learning project
- The purpose of this project is to try different classification methods and identify the best model with the highest accuracy.
- In this project we used various classification algorithms like 
  - Logistic Regression classifier
  - SVM classifier
  - KNN classifier
  - Random Forest classifier
  - Decision Tree classifier

## Here it is how we have observed the segregation of the data.
## Types
- Registers :
  The number of times various different registers are called

- Opcodes :
  The number of times various different opcodes are called

- APIs :
  The number of times various different extern system functions are called.

- Misc :
  The number of times various kinds of variables are defined.
